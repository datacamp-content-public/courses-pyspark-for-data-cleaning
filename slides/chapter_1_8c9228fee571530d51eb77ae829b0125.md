## What are Outliers?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "662fd7ac14"
```

`@part1`
- Outliers are extreme values that fall far outside the mean and standard deviation of a set of observations.
- Outliers can mislead the training process in building machine learning models.
- Outliers may be real anomalies in the observations or artificial errors.

## Identify Outliers based on Extreme Value Analysis

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "e86037980b"
```

`@part1`
- Assumes a normal distribution
- Expected values fall within 1.5 times 1st & 3rd quartile
- Find observations outside the 1.5 * IQR
- Flag outliers for removal
